# Sprint 1_Exceptions

📄 **Description - Exercise Statement**

This project involves creating two classes in Java: "Product" and "Sale". The "Product" class has attributes for name and price, while the "Sale" class contains a collection of products and the total sale price. The "Sale" class includes a method named `calculateTotal()`, which throws a custom exception "EmptySaleException" if no products have been added. This exception is a subclass of `Exception`, and its constructor takes a message that should be displayed when the exception is caught.
